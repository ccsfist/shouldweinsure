- Rule 1 red markers: 1

- Rule 1 blue markers: 4

- Rule 2 red markers: 2

- Rule 2 blue markers: 3

- Number of actual draws depends on what happens in the simulation

- Red drawn on average: 1

- Is the number equal--depends on what happened in the simulation

- Should it be exactly the same: Not necessarily (but it is possible)

- What does this mean:  We are only approximating frequency and probabilities by looking at a short number of draws, which can lead to errors

- What can we do: If we only have a short number of years, we can work to put bounds on the levels of errors that exist, and try to design programs that are robust to these errors.

- Do we need to be careful:  YES!

# Asking if we should?

I was asked by the Columbia Climate School to host a "Hot Topics" seminar, to debate if an 
assumption that was the center of my activity was true.  I've always been working to massively scale insurance, but haddnt really 
questioned if we should.

On Feb 6 Columbia Climate School Hot Topics Seminar, we debated if we should scale index insurace to the global majority-and if we could do it responsibly.

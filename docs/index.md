# Asking if we should?

I was asked by the Columbia Climate School to host a "Hot Topics" seminar, to debate if an 
assumption that was the center of my activity was true.  I've always been working to massively scale insurance, but hadn't really 
questioned if we should.
On Feb 6 Columbia Climate School Hot Topics Seminar, we debated if we should scale index insurance to the global majority-and if we could do it responsibly.

## **Good Stuff: Below the presentation**

Scroll down below the presentation to the "Can we do it?" section to see how people answered the hot topics questions.  These default to the answers from the class, and will include more if I have time to update it.  I find the answers to be a fun adventure, so I recommend slowly scrolling through it to see how it unfolds!

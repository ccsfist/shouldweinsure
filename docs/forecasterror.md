# Forecast Error 

![](yearforecasthumantable.png)

The humanitarian events are now listed in the figure alongside the forecasts.  
They are presented in terms of rank, 
the year with the highest number of food insecure people is ranked 1, 
and the second highest number is 2, and so on.  

This table is only a snippet of a much longer table that you will see in future steps.  The longer table extends from 2000-2024, the worst years. The worst year, through the 5th worst year did happened 
in years other than 2015-2019, so the worst year in the table 
starts with the number 6.

## Imagine you have a hat

Let's build some intuition about the probabilities that result from your disaster mandate, and the historical information.

Imagine you have a hat, and several markers.  

- Some of the markers are red, and represent disaster action years

- Some of the markers are blue, and represent non-action years

You will be drawing from a hat to simulate disaster action.

You are allowed to put 5 markers in the to represent the probabilities of action.  

Prepare yourself, and then fill out the form below
